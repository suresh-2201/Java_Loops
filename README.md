# Loops in Java
Loops in Java allow you to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. Java provides several types of loops: 
<br>
for, while, and do-while. Each loop type serves different purposes and can be used depending on the specific needs of the code.
<br>
For Loop: Best used when the number of iterations is known.
<br>
While Loop: Ideal for scenarios where the loop continues until a specific condition is met.
<br>
Do-While Loop: Useful when the loop body needs to execute at least once, regardless of the condition.
<br>
Enhanced For Loop: Convenient for iterating over arrays and collections.

Understanding and using loops effectively can significantly enhance your ability to write efficient and concise code in Java.
